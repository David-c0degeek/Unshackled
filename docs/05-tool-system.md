# Tool System

## Purpose

Tools are the only path from model output to local side effects. Every tool call
must pass through schema validation, permission policy, execution, and result
normalization.

## Tool Trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Tool: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn schema(&self) -> serde_json::Value;
    async fn invoke(&self, invocation: ToolInvocation) -> anyhow::Result<ToolOutput>;
}
```

## Builtin Tools

### `read_file`

Reads UTF-8 text from a workspace path.

Rules:

- deny paths outside workspace unless approved
- deny secret-like files by default
- support line ranges
- cap output size

### `write_file`

Writes a new file or replaces an existing file.

Rules:

- require approval for overwrite until trust is established
- create parent directories only inside workspace
- preserve newline style where possible

### `edit_file`

Applies structured edits.

Rules:

- reject ambiguous edits
- require exact old text or AST-aware operation
- show diff before approval when interactive

### `list_files`

Lists files under a workspace path.

Rules:

- respect ignore files
- cap result count
- include hidden files only when requested

### `search_text`

Searches text using ripgrep when available.

Rules:

- respect ignore files by default
- cap matches
- never traverse outside workspace without approval

### `run_shell`

Runs a shell command.

Rules:

- classify command risk
- approve writes, deletes, network, package installs, and privileged commands
- set timeout
- capture stdout/stderr separately
- never chain destructive commands generated from untrusted path lists

### `git_status`

Reads repository state.

Rules:

- read-only
- allowed by default inside workspace

### `git_commit`

Creates commits for harness steps.

Rules:

- pre-commit rules must pass
- message must not contain secrets
- include only intended files

## Permission Model

Decision:

- `Allow`: run immediately
- `Ask`: prompt user
- `Deny`: block and return model-visible error

Inputs:

- tool name
- normalized path
- command classification
- workspace trust
- interactive/non-interactive mode
- user policy
- harness rule state

## Result Model

Tool result text must be:

- bounded
- deterministic enough for tests
- explicit about truncation
- free of secrets where redaction is possible

## Safety Invariants

- The model cannot execute a tool outside the registry.
- The model cannot bypass permission policy.
- The harness cannot bypass permission policy.
- Tool outputs are stored only after redaction.
- A failed tool call is represented as data, not a process crash.
