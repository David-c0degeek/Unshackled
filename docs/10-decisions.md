## ADR-0005: Read-Only Local Behavior Reference

Status: accepted

A local working implementation may be inspected as a read-only behavior
reference while planning and implementing this Rust project.

The reference may be used to clarify expected workflows, command behavior,
configuration shape, user-facing edge cases, and high-level product
requirements. It must not be used as source material for copied, translated, or
mechanically ported code, prompts, tests, private endpoint behavior,
implementation structure, identifiers, UI copy, branding, or other prohibited
material.

Reason:

- preserves momentum while the Rust specs are still incomplete
- gives implementers a working behavior baseline for ambiguous flows
- keeps this repository independently authored and clean-room auditable
- makes provenance expectations explicit in planning and review

## ADR-0004: No Private Endpoint Adapters

Status: accepted

Unshackled will not implement adapters for private, undocumented, or
consumer-product endpoints. Provider integrations must use official APIs, local
servers, or explicit user-owned custom endpoints.

Reason:

- reduces legal and account risk
- keeps provider contracts stable
- avoids brittle reverse-engineered behavior
- preserves trust in the project

## ADR-0003: Project Files Are Harness Source of Truth

Status: accepted

The harness treats `brief.md` and `PROGRESS.md` as authoritative. Transcripts
are helpful context but not authoritative state.

Reason:

- users can inspect and edit plans
- sessions can resume after crashes
- implementation remains auditable

## ADR-0002: Provider-Neutral Core

Status: accepted

The core crate must not depend on provider-specific APIs or payload shapes.

Reason:

- avoids coupling the product to one vendor
- makes local models first-class
- keeps tests independent of network access

## ADR-0001: Rust Workspace with Narrow Crates

Status: accepted

Unshackled is split into narrow crates rather than one large binary crate.

Reason:

- clearer boundaries
- easier clean-room review
- smaller test surfaces
- easier future embedding
