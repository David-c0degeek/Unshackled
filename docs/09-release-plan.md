Pre-1.0 compatibility:

- CLI commands may change

## Release Channels

### Nightly

Built from main. No stability guarantee.

### Alpha

Feature-complete enough for real users. Known gaps documented.

### Stable

Requires:

- at least two provider implementations
- mature permission model
- stable config schema
- installer coverage
- documented extension API

## Public Alpha Criteria

- clean-room audit complete
- no private endpoints
- no prohibited product framing
- `cargo test --workspace` green
- basic TUI usable
- harness can complete a small repo task
- docs explain provider setup
- security model documented

## Installer Targets

V1:

- cargo install
- GitHub release archives
- PowerShell install script
- shell install script

Later:

- Homebrew tap
- winget

## Release Checklist

Before tagging:

- update changelog
- run full test matrix
- run dependency audit
- run clean-room scan
- verify license files
- verify no `.env` or token-like content
- verify generated archives contain expected files
- create signed tag if signing is configured

## Clean-Room Scan Terms

Scan for:

- "source-map"
- "leaked"
- "free build"
- "fork of"
- "private endpoint"
- vendor product names used as identity
- personal absolute paths
- browser-cookie auth for hosted models

Provider names in official API docs are allowed when used only as integration
labels.
