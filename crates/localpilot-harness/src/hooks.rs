//! The typed internal hook fabric.
//!
//! The Rust analogue of an extension event bus, built so that extensibility
//! *is* the safety model rather than a way around it:
//!
//! - **Observers** are notify-only lifecycle listeners (turn start/end, tool
//!   execution, compaction, recovery, quota transitions).
//! - **Context hooks** may inject system context before a turn — the one
//!   sanctioned "rewrite context" mutation, applied through the same
//!   `seed_system` path a host would use.
//! - **Tool gates** ([`localpilot_tools::ToolGate`]) run *after* the
//!   permission engine inside dispatch and can only block, never grant. The
//!   permission engine is the always-on first link of that chain.
//!
//! Hook code is in-process, compiled-in Rust: trusted by construction.
//! Third-party extension code never loads in-process — it integrates
//! out-of-process over the RPC/ACP protocols or as an MCP server, where the
//! permission engine mediates it like any other tool source (see
//! docs/extending.md).
