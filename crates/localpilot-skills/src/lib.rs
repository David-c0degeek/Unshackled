//! Skill discovery and suggestion for LocalPilot.
//!
//! Owns skill discovery and loading, the skill manifest format, and skill
//! suggestion heuristics that generate disabled drafts from repeated workflows.
//! Auto-generated skills are suggestions until the user reviews and accepts them.
//! Skills declare the permissions their scripts/assets need; those declarations
//! are surfaced before execution and enforced by the permission engine — a skill
//! is never a permission side channel.
