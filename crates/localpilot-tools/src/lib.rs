//! Tool system for LocalPilot.
//!
//! Tools are the only path from model output to local side effects. Every call
//! goes through one registry that validates input against a generated schema,
//! authorizes each effect through the permission engine, executes, and redacts
//! the result. This crate owns local side effects; permission decisions live in
//! `localpilot-sandbox`, and the registry never bypasses them.
