//! Model Context Protocol integration for Unshackled.

//! Owns the MCP client: handshake, tool discovery, resource reads, and server
//! configuration/health. The defining rule is that MCP tools are not a side
//! channel — every MCP tool call is exposed as an ordinary [`Tool`] and runs
//! through the *same* permission engine and redaction pipeline as a builtin
//! tool. An MCP write prompts or is denied exactly like a builtin write.
