# 03 — Durable Sessions: Store Convergence + Event-Log Tree

## Goal
Replace final-message-only persistence with a durable, versioned, tree-shaped
session event log (research W1 core), after first deciding which store owns
what (the two-memory-systems problem, review §6.2). The event log is designed
as a tree (`parent_id`) from day one so the harness's anti-sunk-cost replan
loop maps onto fork/branch and becomes replayable and auditable. Also lands the
transcript-fidelity and compaction-correctness fixes that belong to the session
loop. Requires subjects 01–02 `DONE` (D001).

## Boxes
> ID = `<subject-id>.<box-number>`. Stable — never renumber; mark retired boxes
> done and struck with `ABANDONED; see D###`, don't delete.
> Owner MUST be one of: agent · release-engineer · product-owner · tech-lead ·
> domain-sme.

- [x] **03.1** (agent) Memory/store convergence ADR drafted: decide ownership
      between the LocalPilot store and embedded LocalMind (e.g. LocalMind as
      the only memory backend; LocalPilot store as transcript/event-only), and
      a single redaction stack (today two stacks with different pattern sets).
      The event-log schema in 03.3 depends on this decision. (Review §6.2.)
- [x] **03.2** (product-owner) Approve the convergence ADR. Mirrored in
      `manual-actions.md`. Approved 2026-06-10; ADR-0011 promoted to accepted.
- [x] **03.3** (agent) Session event log in the store: typed event enum
      covering at minimum session open/close (with open reason), user input
      admitted, provider turn start/end, text/reasoning/usage deltas or
      summaries, tool call recorded / permission decision / tool execution
      start/end, recovery diagnostic, quota pause/resume, compaction, harness
      step transitions, cancellation. Every entry carries `id`, `parent_id`,
      and a session format version; loading an older version migrates on load
      (§6.21). Roundtrip + migration tests. (Research §5.3, §9 W1; survey
      Priority 2 for the event inventory.)
- [x] **03.4** (agent) `SessionRuntime` emits events without behavior change;
      the transcript is derivable from the event log, and a derivation test
      proves rebuilt-transcript == stored-transcript for a representative
      session (tool calls, denial, recovery, compaction).
- [x] **03.5** (agent) Transcript fidelity: synthetic conversation-shaping
      messages (repair prompts, invalid-tool-call feedback) are persisted and
      marked as synthetic, so a resumed/replayed session reconstructs exactly
      the history the model saw. Pins reliability-contract invariant (d) from
      02.6. (Review §3.1.)
- [x] **03.6** (agent) Compaction correctness: a truncation pass shrinks
      oversized kept exchanges (oldest tool-result outputs first) before
      giving up, so one huge tool result cannot exceed the budget with nothing
      left to drop; the degenerate-output flood check scans only the new tail
      with bounded look-back; the per-iteration compaction result is cached
      until history changes. (Review §3.2, §3.4; trigger math stays in subject
      04 per D004.)
- [x] **03.7** (agent) Replan-as-branch: a discarded harness step attempt
      closes its branch with a structured branch summary; a replan forks from
      the last good step. One structured summary format shared between
      compaction and branch summaries. Demonstrated by a harness test that
      replays a replanned run from the event log. (Research §5.3, §5.4.)

## Hindsight checkpoint
> Run after all boxes in this subject are complete and before marking the
> subject `DONE` in §5 of `tasks/NextPhase-Plan.md`. Use the plan's embedded
> "Appendix: Captain Hindsight Prompt". Record the review result here. An
> interim run after a large or risky box is allowed and recorded the same way;
> it does not replace the closing run.
>
> Required output sections: Keep; Fix before closing; Record; Risk; Verdict
> (`CLOSE` or `DO NOT CLOSE`). If the verdict is `DO NOT CLOSE`, leave the
> subject open, add/reopen boxes or update decisions/lessons, and rerun this
> checkpoint after the fixes.

- [x] Captain Hindsight review recorded (interim — agent boxes 03.1, 03.3–03.7;
      subject stayed open until product-owner box 03.2 resolved)
- [x] Verdict is `CLOSE` (03.2 approved 2026-06-10; ADR-0011 accepted)

**Captain Hindsight review (2026-06-10, interim after 03.1, 03.3–03.7):**

1. **Keep:** Deriving a message's event origin from the message itself
   (`origin_for` + the `synthetic` metadata marker) — emission sites cannot
   disagree with the payload, which is what makes the derivation test
   (`transcript_from_events == read_transcript`) structural rather than
   coincidental. Nesting the event kind (not serde-flatten) after the flatten
   id-collision failure. The format-version loader with an explicit per-version
   migration arm and a typed error for newer-than-supported. The incremental
   `StreamMonitor` proven equivalent to the full rescan by proptest over random
   chunkings. `StructuredSummary` shared between compaction and branch
   closures.
2. **Fix before closing:** none in code — full gate green. 03.2 (convergence
   ADR approval) is the only open box.
3. **Record:** ADR-0011 (store convergence) drafted as `proposed`;
   docs/localmind-integration.md updated to cite it. The `Compacted` event is
   emitted on each *recomputation* that compacts (cache-keyed), so a long
   over-limit session logs one entry per history change — accurate, slightly
   chatty; revisit only if log size becomes a problem.
4. **Risk:** `BranchForked` is emitted only on the discard-and-reset path,
   which the resume loop does not currently feed (it only produces `Retry`
   results); a replan ends the run and the next run re-opens the step with a
   fresh `StepStarted`. The fork plumbing is tested at the schema level and
   wired, but no production path exercises it yet — the subagent/checkpoint
   follow-on plan will. `PermissionDecided` events likewise await the hook
   fabric (06) to be emitted.
5. **Verdict:** engineering work CLOSE; subject remains open solely on the
   human approval box 03.2.

- 2026-06-10 · slice 1 · 03.1, 03.3–03.7 · ADR-0011 (store convergence)
  drafted; durable tree-shaped session event log in the store (typed kinds,
  id/parent_id, format version 1 with migrate-on-load + newer-version typed
  error, roundtrip/migration tests); runtime emits events for open/turn/
  message/usage/tool/recovery/quota/compaction/step/branch/cancel; transcript
  derivable from events (derivation test covers denial + recovery + compaction
  + synthetic repair prompt); synthetic messages persisted + marked
  (metadata.synthetic); compaction gains last-resort tool-result truncation,
  StructuredSummary digests, and a generation-keyed cache; live flood check is
  an O(delta) StreamMonitor with a proptest equivalence proof; replan closes
  its branch with a structured summary and the replay test reconstructs the
  run from the log alone. Verified: fmt/clippy/full workspace tests green.
  Checkpoint: committed + pushed. 03.2 (product-owner) remains open.
