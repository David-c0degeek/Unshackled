## 1. Subject

Implement the discovered project quality gate spec'd in ADR-0009 and
`docs/06-harness-spec.md`: a set of language-specific inspection checks, drawn
from built-in toolchain profiles, discovered per project, ratified into
`.unshackled.toml`, run by the rule engine at a per-check cadence, and acted on
(safe auto-fix + bounded retry/replan; block on dependency/audit findings).

**In scope:** `[[harness.checks]]` config; toolchain-profile abstraction with a
Rust profile and one second profile to prove generality; stack detection + tool
probing producing a *proposed* gate; check execution through the existing
permission/sandbox path with output→findings parsing; a `quality_gate` rule with
a phase cadence; the act-on-findings loop; ratification surface + security model.

**Out of scope:** new providers; TUI views beyond surfacing gate results; deep
per-tool finding parsers beyond exit-code + a minimal structured parse; profiles
beyond the two built here (later profiles are follow-on work, not this plan).

## 4. Decision log

> Append-only. Spec deviations recorded here; durable architecture calls promoted
> to an ADR in `docs/10-decisions.md` and cited by number.

| ID | Date | Title | Decision | Rationale | Refs (box IDs / files / ADR#) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D001 | 2026-06-04 | Plan created | Build the quality gate as a Tier-L plan, dogfooding `plan-large-task`. | ADR-0009 is accepted; spec is in docs/06/05/07. | ADR-0009 |
| D002 | 2026-06-04 | Checks are program+args, not a shell string | `CheckConfig` stores `program: String` + `args: Vec<String>`, not a `command` string. | `run_shell` runs an arg list with no shell interpretation; storing a string would force unsafe splitting. The docs/06 `command = "…"` example is presentational; config is structured. | 01.1, builtins.rs |
| D003 | 2026-06-04 | Gate uses a distinct tool identity | Check execution presents a dedicated tool name (e.g. `quality_check`) to the permission engine, not `run_shell`. | The Relaxed allowlist matches by **tool name**; allowlisting `run_shell` would auto-approve all shell. A distinct identity lets ratification allow only the gate. | 03.1, 06.2, permission.rs |
| D004 | 2026-06-04 | Gate-runner lives in `unshackled-harness` | Profiles, discovery, and the gate-runner live in `unshackled-harness`, reusing `unshackled-sandbox` `classify`/`PermissionEngine` and the run_shell spawn pattern. | Loop-adjacent; avoids a new crate; keeps classification/permission single-sourced. | 00.6, 02, 03 |
| D005 | 2026-06-04 | Ratification = permission allowance | Ratifying the gate records the checks AND grants their tool identity an allowance (relaxed allowlist / equivalent) so cargo `ProjectWrite` checks run non-interactively. | cargo fmt/clippy/test classify `ProjectWrite` → non-interactive Default = Deny; without an allowance the gate could never run headless. | 06.1, 06.2, permission.rs |
| D007 | 2026-06-04 | Verdict mapping landed in subject 04, not 05 | `gate_verdict` (finding→verdict) lives in `rules.rs` with the `quality_gate` rule; `CheckOutcome` carries the check's `severity`. | The rule can't compile without the mapping; 05.1 originally planned it. Subject 05 now only wires the loop + `DECISIONS.md`, consuming the rule's Retry/Block verdicts. | 04.3, 05.1, rules.rs |
| D006 | 2026-06-04 | Baseline clippy was pre-existing red — RESOLVED | `cargo clippy --all-targets` failed on `unshackled-config/tests/config.rs` (unwrap in non-`#[test]` helper fns). User chose proper handling (no lint allow): recover the poisoned env lock and make `isolated()` return `TestResult` so callers propagate with `?`. Gate green. Commit `b6b7791`. | Honest baseline; resume-safe checkpoints require a green gate. | 00.3, config tests, b6b7791 |
| D008 | 2026-06-04 | Replan records-and-halts; no in-loop plan regeneration | On replan-cap exhaustion `resume_one_step` appends to `DECISIONS.md` and returns the step uncommitted ("queued for replanning"); it does **not** regenerate `PROGRESS.md` in the loop. Plan regeneration stays the existing `plan --replan` command. `MAX_REPLANS` is an in-crate constant (no config field); `today()`/civil-date is in-crate (no date dep). | Keeps the highest-risk core-loop edit (auto-rewriting the plan mid-resume) out of scope while still making the deviation durable. YAGNI on a config knob and a date crate. | 05.2, 05.3, resume.rs, decisions.rs |
| D009 | 2026-06-04 | Gate allowance is runtime-derived; docs match shipped config | (a) D005's "allowance" is granted at runtime: `resume` adds `quality_check` to the relaxed allowlist iff ratified checks exist — no `[permissions].allowlist` schema field, no textual edit of an existing `[permissions]` table. (b) docs/06's `[[harness.checks]]` example is rewritten to the structured `program`/`args` form `gate ratify` emits, superseding D002's "presentational" `command = "…"` shorthand (which never parsed). | (a) No serializer dep available (figment reads only); appending array-of-tables is clean but editing an existing table is not — runtime derivation is simpler and keeps the allowance scoped to the gate identity. (b) A copy-pasted `command = "…"` check fails the loader (`program` required); docs must match shipped. | 06.1, 06.2, 06.5, harness_cmd.rs, permission.rs, docs/06 |

## 6. Cross-cutting principles

1. KISS · YAGNI · CLEAN · SOLID · DRY (in that order when conflicting).
2. **Clean-room provenance is blocking** — original code/prompts/tests; official
   public APIs or local servers only. See `clean-room-guard`, `docs/00-clean-room.md`.
3. **Rust rules hold** (docs/13): MSRV 1.82, exact-pinned workspace deps, typed
   errors per crate, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` on
   library runtime paths, cross-platform path/shell discipline.
4. **Tier-1 parity** (ADR-0007): a check that only works on one OS is not done.
   Profiles must classify Windows and POSIX commands correctly.
5. **Security is not optional** (ADR-0009, docs/07): discovered commands are
   untrusted. Discovery proposes; the user ratifies into committed config; every
   check runs through the permission engine and sandbox. No standing bypass.
6. **The engine stays stack-neutral.** Profiles are the fixed abstraction;
   commands/versions/paths are discovered. No hardcoded tool list inside the rule
   engine.
7. **Findings are data, not crashes.** A failing check is a finding mapped to a
   verdict, never a process panic (mirrors the tool result model, docs/05).
8. **The harness never blind-edits logic** to satisfy a check; it fixes via a
   declared `fix_command` or feeds the failure back through the loop.
9. Every box has an owner (`agent` unless human sign-off) and a stable ID.
10. Lessons land in `tasks/quality-gate/lessons.md` as they happen.
11. **Plan-agnostic output** (§6.11): commits/identifiers/comments/tests carry no
    box IDs, decision IDs, `slice`, or plan filenames. Put the *why* in the
    comment or an ADR.
12. **Captain Hindsight** before each subject close (§ Appendix in the template).
13. Tooling research (subject 00) before implementation subjects start.
14. Resume-safe checkpoints: plan update → gate → commit → push.
