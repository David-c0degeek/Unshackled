- 2026-06-04 · The rule engine already models `Verdict::Retry/Discard/Block` and
  `Trigger` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the gate extends cleanly — add a
  `PhaseComplete` trigger and a `quality_gate` rule rather than a parallel system.
- 2026-06-04 · `HarnessConfig.test_command` is `Option<String>`; the gate must
  keep it as a back-compat synonym for a single phase `test` check.
- 2026-06-04 · `run_shell` runs program+args with NO shell. Store checks as
  program+args (D002), not a command string — avoids unsafe word-splitting.
- 2026-06-04 · The Relaxed permission allowlist matches by TOOL NAME, not by
  command. The gate needs its own tool identity (D003) or allowlisting it would
  open all shell. Ratification must also grant that identity an allowance (D005),
  because cargo checks are `ProjectWrite` = deny non-interactively.
- 2026-06-04 · No `phase` boundary exists in the engine yet; `Trigger` is
  `#[non_exhaustive]` so `PhaseComplete` adds cleanly, but the loop must define
  what a phase is (subject 04, after reading worker.rs/resume.rs).
- 2026-06-04 · BLOCKER: baseline `clippy --all-targets` red on config tests
  (D006), pre-existing. Every checkpoint gate is red until fixed. RESOLVED s3.
- 2026-06-04 · `unshackled_sandbox::classify()` dispatches per OS
  (classify_windows vs classify_posix). Cross-platform tests must assert against a
  `CommandClass` directly, not feed a POSIX command (`rm -rf`) and expect
  `Destructive` — on Windows that classifies `Unknown`. Bites subject 05's
  cross-platform act-on-findings box.
- 2026-06-04 · `recovery::detect("", false)` flags an empty turn as
  `BadOutputKind::EmptyTurn` → `REPAIR_PROMPT` → eventually `MaxTurns`. So a
  multi-attempt resume test must script every attempt to emit **non-empty** text,
  and a `tool_call` attempt needs a trailing `text(...)` to close the turn (the
  post-tool stream would otherwise be the empty default `Done`). `FakeProvider`
  scripts are a single FIFO across all `stream()` calls, not per `run_turn`.
- 2026-06-04 · The live loop is `resume_one_step`, not `StepLoop` directly —
  `StepLoop` existed but was test-only. Subject 05 made `resume_one_step` drive it.
  The gate runs at `StepComplete` only; `PhaseComplete` has no driver yet (the
  phase-boundary surface is subject 06).
- 2026-06-04 · No TOML serializer is available (figment reads only; no `toml`/
  `toml_edit` dep). `gate ratify` therefore renders `[[harness.checks]]` by hand
  and **appends** — appending array-of-tables is valid TOML and preserves the
  user's config+comments, but you cannot append a key to an existing `[permissions]`
  table. That ruled out a config-persisted allowlist, so the D005 allowance is
  runtime-derived instead (D009).
- 2026-06-04 · docs/06's `command = "…"` check example never parsed — the loader
  requires `program`. `gate ratify` emits `program`/`args`. Subject 06 rewrote the
  doc to the structured form (D009); when docs show config, render what the code
  actually reads/writes.
- 2026-06-04 · Plan-agnostic check bites tests too: a `// D005:` comment in a
  shipped test is leakage. Cite the durable ADR (ADR-0009), not the build-plan
  decision id. Note the DECISIONS.md model's own `D###` ids are domain content,
  not leakage.
