# Unshackled-Plan.md — v1 Implementation Plan

> Multi-slice, autonomous-agent-driven plan to take Unshackled from its
> clean-room scaffold to a public alpha (`v0.1.0-alpha.1`). Built on
> `tasks/plan-template.md`.
>
> **Disposable.** This plan and `tasks/unshackled/` are deleted (or archived out
> of the repo) once v1 alpha ships. Shipped code, comments, tests, identifiers,
> and commit messages MUST NOT reference this plan, subjects, box IDs, or
> decision IDs — see §6.11.

> **Terms.**
> - **Subject** — one file `tasks/unshackled/NN-<slug>.md`. 10 here (00–09).
> - **Box** — one `[ ]` item in a subject, ID `<subject-id>.<box-number>`
>   (e.g. `03.2`). Stable; never renumbered.
> - **Slice** — one agent work-session, one line in a subject's Progress log.

## 1. Subject

**In scope.** Implement Unshackled v1 as specified in `docs/` and `README.md`:
a Rust-native, provider-neutral, local-first coding-agent harness with two
operating modes (default conversational **agent mode** and enforced **harness
mode**), running on Windows, Linux, and macOS as equal tier-1 platforms. v1
delivers, end to end: config loading with deterministic precedence; provider
runtime (one local OpenAI-compatible provider + one official hosted provider)
behind one trait with streaming, capabilities, quota metadata, and recovery;
the eight builtin tools through a permission engine with three profiles
(`default`/`relaxed`/`bypass`); the session/agent loop with cancellation,
limits, context compaction, and bad-output recovery; the full harness (brief +
progress parse/render, `init`, `status`, `intake`, `plan`, `feature`, `resume`,
deterministic rule engine, anti-sunk-cost replan loop, per-step commits);
quota wait/resume with safety gates; MCP client; local memory store; skills
incl. generated drafts; a ratatui/crossterm TUI; a golden-task eval suite; and
release hardening (installers, supply-chain gates, clean-room audit, docs) to
the §9 "Public Alpha Criteria". The current v1 memory/skills surfaces are the
native alpha bridge toward LocalMind, the extracted learning engine that
Unshackled will ship as a built-in subsystem.

**Out of scope** (per `docs/01-product-spec.md` Non-Goals / Later / Out of
Scope): cloud sync; remote-execution service; web UI surface; remote agents;
multi-repo orchestration; plugin/skill marketplace; image input; IDE
integration; model training/fine-tuning; voice; hidden telemetry; any private
or undocumented consumer-product endpoint adapter. Anything resembling a vendor
clone, copied prompts, or copied identifiers is prohibited, not merely
out of scope (see `docs/00-clean-room.md`, §6.12 below).

## 2. Authoritative inputs

| Source | Contribution |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Product identity, repo layout, crate roster, first-milestone command surface, design principles. |
| `docs/00-clean-room.md` | Hard provenance rules; allowed inputs; read-only-reference policy; PR provenance-note format; prohibited framing. **Blocking.** |
| `docs/01-product-spec.md` | Product definition, 7 core jobs, two operating modes, interfaces, user-facing files, first-milestone vs v1-committed vs later scope. |
| `docs/02-architecture.md` | System shape, per-crate responsibilities + must-not-own, runtime flows, data model, error handling, observability. Names crates not yet in the workspace (memory, skills, recovery, quota). |
| `docs/03-implementation-plan.md` | Phase 0–15 task lists and "Done when" gates. Primary source for box wording. |
| `docs/04-provider-contract.md` | Provider declaration fields, `ModelRequest`/`ModelEvent`, error taxonomy, provider-differences, quota semantics, required provider tests, config example. |
| `docs/05-tool-system.md` | `Tool` trait, the 8 builtin tools + per-tool rules, permission decisions, result model, safety invariants. |
| `docs/06-harness-spec.md` | Mode/permission flags, `.unshackled.toml`/`brief.md`/`PROGRESS.md` shapes, command I/O, rule triggers/verdicts, baseline rules, anti-sunk-cost loop, commit policy. |
| `docs/07-security-and-privacy.md` | Trust model, workspace trust, redaction, shell classification table, permission profiles, per-platform policy, quota safety gates, supply chain, abuse resistance. |

| `docs/09-release-plan.md` | Versioning, channels, public-alpha criteria, installer targets, release checklist, clean-room scan terms. |
| `docs/10-decisions.md` | ADR-0001..0007 (narrow crates, provider-neutral core, project files = source of truth, no private endpoints, read-only reference, ratatui, tier-1 tri-platform). ADRs win over style rules. |
| `docs/11-implementation-checklist.md` | Flat capability checklist mirrored into boxes; the "Foundation: replace repo URL" item is already done. |
| `docs/12-feature-specs.md` | UI direction (footer stats, thinking panel), bad-output recovery ladder, skill shape/triggers/suggestions, memory store rules + commands, quota modes/config/safety/UI. |
| `docs/13-rust-best-practices.md` | Engineering style guide: MSRV 1.82, exact-pinned workspace deps, type-driven design, `thiserror` per crate, async/Tokio rules, cross-platform path/shell discipline, secret wrapper, lints (`-D warnings`), test toolbox, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. **Blocking review rules.** |
| `docs/14-dev-tooling.md` | Assistant skills, optional MCP servers, cargo tools to install, repo conveniences, the repo project-skills to author and their order. Source for the §00 bootstrap subject. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `SECURITY.md` | PR requirements + provenance note; security scope and defaults. |
| Existing scaffold (`crates/*`, `Cargo.toml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deny.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`) | Current state to build on, not replace. 10 stub crates, MSRV/edition pinned, CI fmt+clippy+test+check on 3 OSes. |
| Read-only behavior reference `D:\repos\unshackled` (ADR-0005) | High-level workflow/edge-case clarification ONLY when local docs are silent. Never a source of code/prompts/identifiers/tests; requires a PR provenance note when consulted. |
| LocalMind plan in `D:\repos\localmind` | Extracted learning-engine direction: LocalMind owns learning/memory promotion/review/skill self-improvement core; Unshackled is the first native host and owns runtime capture, permissions, TUI, and bundled UX. |

**`<base>`** = `main` at commit `eab7123` (plan branches from here).

## 4. Decision log

> Append-only. Every deviation from a spec literal gets a row, with the box
> ID(s) it touches. A spec amendment never disappears into a slice.
>
> **Retiring a subject/box:** mark done+struck
> (`- [x] ~~<box-id> text~~ ABANDONED; see D###`), mark the subject `ABANDONED`
> in §5, add a row here. Never delete — history must survive a context reset.

| ID | Date | Title | Decision | Rationale | Refs (box IDs / files) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D001 | 2026-06-01 | 10 subjects, not 5–8 | Plan uses 10 subject files. | v1 spans 16 spec phases / ~170 checklist items across hard crate seams; bundling by seam is clearer than two competing plans and keeps each subject reviewable. | §3, all subjects |
| D002 | 2026-06-01 | Subject 07 is a known scope-drag risk | Keep quota+MCP+skills+memory in one subject for now; **split trigger**: if execution stalls (a single box open across 3+ slices, or the subject exceeds ~1.5× the slice budget of its neighbours), split 07 into `07a` quota/MCP and `07b` skills/memory, log the split here, and renumber via new files (07a/07b) without renumbering existing boxes. | Highest-surface subject (4 phases). Documenting the trigger now avoids an ad-hoc mid-run reshuffle. | `tasks/unshackled/07-extensions.md` |
| D003 | 2026-06-02 | MCP posture for the run | **Start without MCP servers.** No cargo-wrapper MCPs. Revisit the read-only OpenAI Docs MCP when provider work (subject 03) begins, and only after auditing the server. | `docs/14` §2 recommendation; shell + cargo + LSP cover the workflow and every added MCP is untrusted third-party code on the workspace. | 00.6 |
| D004 | 2026-06-02 | Dev-tool versions pinned to MSRV 1.82 | Install `cargo-nextest 0.9.92`, `cargo-machete 0.7.0`, `cargo-insta 1.47.2`; not the latest. | Latest `cargo-nextest` needs rustc 1.91 and latest `cargo-machete` needs the `edition2024` cargo feature; both exceed the pinned 1.82 toolchain. `nextest 0.9.97-b.2` (the newest 1.82-compatible) segfaults on Windows, so the last stable `0.9.92` is used. Dev tooling only — nothing ships. | 00.2 |
| D005 | 2026-06-02 | `cargo ci` shipped as per-step aliases | `.cargo/config.toml` defines `ci-fmt`/`ci-lint`/`ci-test`/`ci-check` rather than a single `cargo ci`. | Cargo aliases cannot chain multiple subcommands, and a one-shot runner would need an `xtask`/`cargo-make` crate — adding a 15th member conflicts with box 01.1's "14 crates" gate. CONTRIBUTING documents running the four as the local gate. | 01.4 |
| D006 | 2026-06-02 | `deny.toml` wildcards = warn | Internal `{ path = ... }` members read as wildcard deps; `allow-wildcard-paths` does not exempt publishable crates, so `bans.wildcards` is set to `warn` (not `deny`) for now. | Keeps `cargo deny check` green without prematurely deciding the crates.io publish posture (and `publish = false` on every member). Tighten to `deny` + `publish=false` at release (subject 09). | 01.7 |
| D007 | 2026-06-02 | Pin `tempfile 3.14.0` / `getrandom 0.2.15` | Lock `insta`'s transitive `tempfile` to 3.14.0 and `getrandom` to 0.2.15. | `tempfile` ≥3.16 pulls `getrandom` ≥0.3, whose 0.4.x manifest requires the unstable `edition2024` cargo feature and fails to parse under the pinned 1.82 toolchain. Dev/test-only deps. | 01.9 |
| D008 | 2026-06-02 | `ToolUseId` wraps `String`, not `Uuid` | Box 02.1 lists `ToolUseId` among the UUID newtypes; instead it wraps the opaque provider-assigned correlation string. `SessionId`/`TurnId`/`MessageId` still wrap `Uuid`. | A tool-call id must match the token a provider emits and expects back (`docs/04` `ModelEvent::ToolCall { id: String }`); minting our own UUID would force a brittle string↔uuid map in every adapter. Still a distinct newtype, satisfying 02.1's intent. | 02.1, 02.3 |
| D009 | 2026-06-02 | First official hosted provider = OpenAI API | Ship the official **OpenAI** public API as the first hosted provider (03.7). One OpenAI-compatible adapter serves both the local server and official OpenAI; only base URL, auth, and source type differ. | OpenAI's Chat Completions API is fully public and documented (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat>), satisfies ADR-0004, and reuses the local adapter. Provenance noted in `openai.rs` and CONTRIBUTING. | 03.7, 03.13 |
| D010 | 2026-06-02 | Pin provider-runtime transitives to MSRV 1.82 | Lock `hyper-rustls 0.27.5`, `idna_adapter 1.2.0`, and the `getrandom@0.3` line to `0.3.1`. | `reqwest`/`wiremock` otherwise resolve `hyper-rustls`≥0.27.9 (rustc 1.85), `idna_adapter` 1.2.2 and `getrandom` 0.3.4→`wasip2`→`wit-bindgen 0.57` (all need `edition2024`), which fail under 1.82 and break `cargo deny` manifest parsing. | 03.6, 03.12 |
| D011 | 2026-06-02 | deny: allow CDLA-Permissive-2.0, ignore RUSTSEC-2025-0134 | Add `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` to the license allow-list and ignore advisory `RUSTSEC-2025-0134`. | CDLA-Permissive-2.0 is `webpki-roots`' CA-data license (needed for TLS to official APIs), a permissive data license. RUSTSEC-2025-0134 marks transitive `rustls-pemfile` *unmaintained* (no vulnerability); we do not control it directly. | 03.12 |
| D012 | 2026-06-02 | windows-gnu aggregate test crash mitigated | Keep dev-only feature graphs minimal when a member crate is also a dependency of other members. `unshackled-config` no longer enables `figment/test`; its tests use a local env-isolation helper instead. | The local `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` crash was reproduced by selecting `unshackled-config` and `unshackled-harness` together: Cargo unified `figment/test` into the config build used by harness, producing a harness test binary that crashed before listing tests. Removing that dev feature makes `cargo test --workspace` pass locally. | 03 |
| D013 | 2026-06-02 | Session runtime lives in `unshackled-harness`; interactive REPL deferred to the TUI | The shared agent-mode loop is a module in `unshackled-harness` (no separate session crate exists in the 14-crate roster). The interactive agent REPL with live approval prompting and the footer status line are built in subject 08 (TUI); subject 05 ships the non-interactive `print` entry. | The architecture names no session crate; harness is the orchestration layer with one-way deps onto llm/tools/sandbox/store/recovery. Interactive prompting needs the approval modal/footer, which are TUI concerns. | 05.1, 05.8, 05.13 |
| D014 | 2026-06-02 | Quota wait/resume engine done; live `harness wait-resume` CLI wrapper deferred | `unshackled-quota` implements and tests window estimation, the inspectable `PausedRun` format, resume modes, and the safety gates (incl. the step-boundary gate). The thin `unshackled harness wait-resume` CLI command and the session-loop pause-point that classifies a provider quota error and writes the `PausedRun` file are a follow-up wrapper around this engine. | 07.2's verifiable contracts (resume gated to a step boundary; paused state persisted as an inspectable round-trippable file) are met at the engine level; wiring the catch-point into the resume loop is mechanical and lower-risk than the engine. | 07.2 |
| D015 | 2026-06-02 | TUI core decoupled from crossterm; terminal driver lives in the CLI | `unshackled-tui` renders with `ratatui` (default-features off, no crossterm backend) and its own `Key` type, so the whole UI snapshot-tests via `TestBackend`. The committed stack's `crossterm` backend, the `tui-textarea` input widget, and the interactive REPL launch are a thin terminal driver in the CLI that maps real key events to `tui::Key` and runs `tui::run`. | `crossterm`'s terminal init crashes the test harness on the local `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain (D012-class), which would block generating the required snapshots. Decoupling keeps the testable UI logic in `unshackled-tui` and isolates the un-testable terminal I/O at the edge; ADR-0006's stack is honored in the driver, verified on real terminals / MSVC CI. | 08.1, 08.3 |
| D016 | 2026-06-02 | LocalMind is Unshackled's native learning engine | Treat the current `unshackled-memory` and `unshackled-skills` crates as alpha bridge surfaces, not the final rich learning system. LocalMind owns the extracted host-neutral core for session closeout, candidate lessons, review queues, memory promotion, retrieval, skill generation/maintenance, audit, and self-improvement. Unshackled is the first native host and owns session/evidence capture, runtime hooks, permission/TUI integration, and built-in commands. LocalMind core must not depend on Unshackled; Unshackled may depend on LocalMind core through an adapter. | Avoids duplicated memory/skill systems while preserving Unshackled's built-in UX and LocalMind's standalone role for other agents. Since subjects 05-08 have already landed, alpha release must record a forward integration contract rather than reopen completed subject history. | 05, 06, 07, 08, 09.14, `D:\repos\localmind\tasks\LocalMind-Plan.md` |

## 5. Master progress tracker

> A subject is `DONE` when every box in its file is `[x]`. Abandoned boxes use
> the §4 struck-and-done format; an abandoned subject still gets `[x]` in Done.
> §5 is fully ticked when every Done cell is `[x]` and every Status is `DONE` or
> `ABANDONED`.
>
> **Owners** are one of: `agent`, `release-engineer`, `product-owner`,
> `tech-lead`, `domain-sme`. Owner-summary names the specific roles present
> (never a generic "human"). Human-owned boxes are mirrored into
> `tasks/unshackled/manual-actions.md` and kept in sync.

> All boxes complete. `v0.1.0-alpha.1` tagged on `main` (`4a68875`) and pushed on
> owner authorization, triggering `release.yml`. §8 acceptance is the human gate.

## 6. Cross-cutting principles

> Apply to every subject. Violations are blockers, not nits. 1–11 are tuned to
> this Rust plan; the C#/.NET defaults from the template are dropped.

1. **KISS · YAGNI · CLEAN · SOLID · DRY** (in that order when they conflict).
2. **MSRV 1.82 / edition 2021, inherited from the workspace.** No API or syntax
   newer than 1.82. Raising MSRV is its own commit with a `CHANGELOG.md` note
   (`docs/13` §1).
3. **Every external dependency is exact-pinned (`=x.y.z`) in
   `[workspace.dependencies]`** and referenced by members with
   `dep = { workspace = true }`. No second pin in a member crate. New deps must
   pass `deny.toml` and `cargo audit` before use (`docs/13` §1–2).
4. **No new build warnings.** `cargo fmt --check` and
   `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` are gates. Fix the
   cause; any `#[allow(...)]` carries a one-line reason (`docs/13` §9).
5. **Keep crates narrow and dependency direction one-way** (ADR-0001). `core`
   depends on nothing internal; nothing depends on the CLI; no cycles.
   Provider code only in `unshackled-llm`; local side effects only in
   `unshackled-tools`; permission decisions only in `unshackled-sandbox`
   (`docs/13` §2; `docs/02`).
6. **Type-driven design.** Newtypes for IDs/units; `enum` over struct-with-kind;
   parse-don't-validate at boundaries; `#[non_exhaustive]` on growable public
   enums/errors; generate tool/provider JSON schemas from typed structs
   (`schemars`), never hand-written (`docs/13` §3).
7. **Typed errors at every crate boundary with `thiserror`**
   (`ConfigError`, `ProviderError`, `ToolError`, `PermissionError`,
   `HarnessError`, `StoreError`, …). The CLI MAY use `anyhow` at the top only;
   libraries MUST NOT leak `anyhow` across a public boundary. Every fallible
   public fn has a `# Errors` doc (`docs/13` §4).
8. **No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`unimplemented!` on runtime paths**
   in library crates (allowed in `#[cfg(test)]`; `unreachable!` only with a
   proof comment). Each library crate starts `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; `unsafe`
   needs an ADR + `// SAFETY:` (`docs/13` §8, §12).
9. **Async discipline.** Never block the executor; never hold a lock across
   `.await`; prefer `std::sync::Mutex` for short sections; make long ops
   cancellable via `CancellationToken`/`select!` and leave state consistent
   (temp-then-rename, no half-written files); object-safe provider/tool traits
   via `async-trait`; await or deliberately detach every `JoinHandle`
   (`docs/13` §5–6).
10. **Cross-platform from the start** (ADR-0007). Windows, Linux, macOS are
    equal tier-1; behavior parity is a release requirement. Use `Path`/`PathBuf`
    + `.join()`; canonicalize + normalized `starts_with` for workspace
    containment (mind Windows `\\?\`, case-insensitivity, 8.3, ADS); per-OS
    shell/command classification; argument lists not shell strings; `#[cfg]`
    branches must be tested on their OS (CI runs all three) (`docs/13` §7).
11. **Security-by-construction.** Secrets live in a wrapper whose
    `Debug`/`Display` prints `***`; raw value only via explicit `expose()`.
    Redact before persistence and before logging, not after. Treat model
    output, tool input, and provider output as untrusted. The model and the
    harness MUST NOT bypass the permission engine. `bypass` profile is never the
    default and is always shown in footer/status (`docs/07`, `docs/13` §8,
    `docs/05` safety invariants).
12. **Clean-room provenance is blocking** (`docs/00`, ADR-0004/0005). All code,
    prompts, tests, identifiers, UI copy original to this repo. Official public
    APIs / local servers only — no private/undocumented endpoint adapters. Cite
    public API docs in a PR provenance note; when the read-only reference at
    `D:\repos\unshackled` is consulted, add the high-level provenance note from
    `docs/00`. No vendor branding as product identity; no prohibited framing.
13. **Project files are the harness source of truth** (ADR-0003). `brief.md`
    and `PROGRESS.md` are authoritative and user-editable; the next run treats
    the edited file as truth. Transcripts are supporting context only.
14. **Spec at the contract level, not the SDK level.** State requirements as
    testable contracts on observable behaviour (`docs/13` §3, template lesson).
    The smallest verifiable artefact (test name / file path / log line) goes in
    each box.
15. **Tests prove contracts; coverage is a smell-detector, not a goal.** Prefer
    hand-written fakes over mocking frameworks; tests deterministic + offline by
    default (`tempfile`, never the real home/config); live tests opt-in behind
    `UNSHACKLED_LIVE_TESTS`; cover at least one failure path; snapshots reviewed
    deliberately (`docs/13` §10, `docs/08`).
16. **Every box has an owner (§5 enum) and a stable ID** `<subject-id>.<box-number>`.
    Lessons land in `tasks/unshackled/lessons.md` as they happen.
17. **Code is plan-agnostic** (§6.11 template). Comments, test names, commit
    messages, identifiers must read as permanent project artefacts — never
    reference this plan, subjects, box IDs, or `D###`. Put the *why* in the
    comment. Commit messages for harness-produced commits follow the spec's
    `harness: <step description>` shape only inside the product's own runtime,
    not for plan commits.
18. **Captain Hindsight review before subject close.** Before marking any
    future subject `DONE`, run the subject's Hindsight checkpoint using the
    embedded prompt in "Appendix: Captain Hindsight Prompt". Record Keep /
    Fix before closing / Record / Risk / Verdict in the subject file. A
    `DO NOT CLOSE` verdict is a blocker: add or reopen boxes, update §4
    decisions, or append lessons before closing. Subjects 00–04 were marked
    `DONE` before this rule existed; they keep their tracker state, but each
    must receive a retroactive Hindsight checkpoint before §7 is ticked.
19. **LocalMind owns rich learning behavior.** New work on session closeout,
    candidate lessons, review queues, memory promotion, graph/search retrieval,
    skill generation/maintenance, audit, or self-improvement must target the
    LocalMind contract unless a Decision-log row records why the behavior is
    intentionally Unshackled-only. Unshackled owns native capture, runtime hooks,
    permission enforcement, TUI/CLI presentation, and bundled UX.

## 7. Gate review (run last; tick everything)

> Run only when §5 is fully ticked. §7 is the engineering gate; §8 is human
> acceptance after it.

- [x] All §5 subjects `DONE` (or explicitly `ABANDONED` with a §4 row).
- [x] Every subject file has a recorded Captain Hindsight checkpoint with
      verdict `CLOSE`; subjects 00–04 may be retroactive reviews.
- [x] `cargo check --workspace` passes; `cargo build --workspace` passes on all three OSes via CI.
- [x] `cargo fmt --check` clean; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.
- [x] `cargo test --workspace` (or `cargo nextest run --workspace`) green on Windows, Ubuntu, macOS.
- [x] `cargo deny check` and `cargo audit` pass; `cargo machete` reports no unused deps.
- [x] All `docs/08` "Required MVP Tests" exist and pass (config, provider, tools, harness, recovery, context, store).
- [x] Golden-task eval suite runs and reports a task success rate; scorecard fields recorded.
- [x] §6 cross-cutting principles reviewed; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` on library runtime paths; no `anyhow` leaking from a library; no secret reachable via `Debug`/logs; no lock held across `.await`.
- [x] Behavior parity verified across the three tier-1 platforms (ADR-0007); `#[cfg]` branches tested on their OS.
- [x] **Clean-room audit** (`docs/00`, `docs/09`): text scan for prohibited framing terms ("source-map", "leaked", "free build", "fork of", "private endpoint", vendor names as identity, browser-cookie auth); no private/undocumented endpoint adapter; prompts/tests/identifiers original; provenance notes present where the reference was consulted.
- [x] **Personal-absolute-path scan** scoped to shipped artifacts: scan `crates/`, install scripts, and public docs for personal absolute paths and assert zero hits. **Exclude** `tasks/` (disposable, deleted at go-live) and the single documented read-only-reference path `D:\repos\unshackled` in `AGENTS.md`, which ADR-0005 / `docs/00` explicitly allow. A hit anywhere a user would receive it (binary, archive, shipped doc) is a blocker; the documented reference mention is not.
- [x] Shipped artefacts plan-agnostic — grep the repo **excluding `tasks/`** for box IDs (`\b\d\d\.\d+\b`), decision IDs (`\bD\d{3}\b`), `tasks/unshackled/`, `Unshackled-Plan.md`, `\bslices?\b`; zero hits after triage (version strings can match box-ID pattern).
- [x] Commit messages plan-agnostic — `git log <base>..HEAD` mentions no box IDs, `D###`, `tasks/unshackled/`, `Unshackled-Plan.md`, or `slice`/`slices` (same triage). Implementation commits clean; the only `slice` hits are the pre-implementation plan-doc commits that form `<base>`.
- [x] `tasks/unshackled/manual-actions.md` — every human-owned box resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale. (03.14 live-provider creds DEFERRED to the release validation run.)
- [ ] `docs/09` Public-Alpha Criteria met: clean-room audit complete, no private endpoints, no prohibited framing, tests green, TUI usable, harness completes a small repo task, docs explain provider setup, security model documented; installers build; release archives contain license files.
- [x] LocalMind-native learning posture recorded before release: current memory/skills are documented as alpha bridge surfaces, and a checked-in follow-up integration plan/contract exists for replacing/wrapping them with LocalMind core while keeping the feature built into Unshackled. (`docs/localmind-integration.md`, D016.)
- [x] `tasks/unshackled/lessons.md` reconciled; lasting lessons migrated to permanent `tasks/lessons.md` (create if missing) before `tasks/unshackled/` is deleted.
- [ ] Plan handed to reviewer for §8 sign-off.

## Appendix: Captain Hindsight Prompt

```text
You are now Captain Hindsight.

Review the completed subject, phase, box, or major plan section with hindsight.
Assume the work is already done, then identify what is clearer now than it was
before the work started.

Check specifically for:
- Scope drift or missed requirements.
- Spec deviations that need a Decision-log row.
- Lessons that should be recorded before context is lost.
- Tests that pin implementation details instead of observable behavior.
- Complexity, duplication, brittle design, or awkward naming that should be fixed now.
- Human-owned actions that need to be mirrored or resolved.
- Plan references that leaked into shipped code, tests, comments, identifiers, or commit messages.

Return exactly these sections:

1. Keep: what was correct and should remain.
2. Fix before closing: concrete issues, missing tests, spec drift, plan hygiene, or design problems.
3. Record: decisions or lessons that must be added to the plan files.
4. Risk: anything still uncertain after verification.
5. Verdict: CLOSE or DO NOT CLOSE.

If the verdict is DO NOT CLOSE, list the smallest concrete actions needed before
the work can be closed.
