# 09 — Golden-Task Evals and Release Hardening

## Goal
> The eval suite (`docs/08` §Golden-Task Evals, `docs/03` Phase 8) plus Phase 15
> Release Hardening (`docs/03`, `docs/09`). Build a deterministic golden-task
> eval framework that proves the agent actually completes work (not just that
> contracts hold), complete the `docs/08` Required-MVP-Test coverage across the
> workspace, then ship a public alpha: installers, supply-chain gates promoted
> to blocking, clean-room audit, docs, and the `v0.1.0-alpha.1` tag. This
> subject runs last; it depends on every prior subject.

## Boxes
> ID = `09.<box-number>`. Owners: agent · release-engineer · tech-lead.

- [x] **09.1** (agent) Define the golden-task **fixture format** (`docs/08`,
      `docs/11`): small deterministic repos with expected outcomes. Fixtures
      authored for this repo, never copied (`docs/08` Fixture Policy). Tasks:
      create a tiny CLI; add a parser branch; fix a failing test; edit docs +
      code together; recover from a bad tool result; pause/resume after a fake
      quota window. (Verified: fixture schema + at least these six tasks exist.)
- [x] **09.2** (agent) Implement the fake-provider **eval runner** + scorecard
      recording per task: success/failure, model turns, tool calls,
      retries/recoveries, token usage, final git diff, test output (`docs/08`,
      `docs/03` Phase 8 Done-when). Track the success rate over time. (Verified:
      runner executes the six tasks with the fake provider and emits a
      scorecard; a regression in any task shows as a score drop.)
- [x] **09.3** (agent) Add an **optional live-provider eval mode** behind
      `UNSHACKLED_LIVE_TESTS`, skipping without credentials, never in default CI,
      avoiding destructive tools, prompts minimal (`docs/08` Live Tests,
      `docs/11` Evals). (Verified: live mode gated by env var; skips cleanly when
      unset.)
- [x] **09.4** (agent) Sweep the `docs/08` "Required MVP Tests" matrix and
      confirm every listed test exists and passes across crates (Config,
      Provider, Tools, Harness, Recovery, Context, Store). Fill any gaps found.
      (Verified: a checklist mapping each `docs/08` MVP test to a real test name;
      `cargo nextest run --workspace` green on all three OSes.)
- [x] **09.5** (agent) Verify **behavior parity** across Windows, Linux, macOS
      (ADR-0007, `docs/01` release requirement): every `#[cfg]` branch has a test
      that runs on its OS; CI matrix green on all three. Run `/verify`/`/run`
      against `unshackled doctor` and the Milestone-1 harness commands on at
      least the host platform. (Verified: CI green ×3; a manual run log of the
      Milestone-1 command sequence.)
- [x] **09.6** (agent) Promote the supply-chain CI jobs to **blocking** and run
      them clean: `cargo deny check`, `cargo audit`, `cargo machete` (`docs/14`
      §4, `docs/07` Supply Chain, `docs/09`). Dependency license review against
      `deny.toml`. (Verified: CI fails on an advisory/unused-dep/forbidden
      license; current tree passes.)
- [x] **09.7** (agent) Add the **installers** (`docs/09` Installer Targets V1):
      `cargo install` path, GitHub release archives, a PowerShell install script,
      and a shell install script. Release archives include the license files
      (`docs/09` Release Checklist). (Verified: archive build contains the binary
      + `LICENSE-MIT`; install scripts parse/lint clean.)
- [x] **09.8** (agent) Write/refresh **public docs** for alpha (`docs/09`
      Public-Alpha Criteria): install docs, provider setup (official API + local
      server config from `docs/04`), security-model summary, and an alpha release
      notes draft. Keep all framing clean-room-compliant (`docs/00` Prohibited
      Framing, `docs/09` Clean-Room Scan Terms). Update `CHANGELOG.md`. (Verified:
      docs render; a draft `docs` set covers install + provider setup + security.)
- [x] **09.9** (agent) Run the **clean-room scan** (`docs/00` Repository Hygiene,
      `docs/09` Clean-Room Scan Terms): text scan for prohibited framing
      ("source-map", "leaked", "free build", "fork of", "private endpoint",
      vendor names as identity, personal absolute paths, browser-cookie auth);
      verify no private endpoints in code/tests; verify no `.env`/token-like
      content committed; verify example endpoints are official public APIs or
      localhost; verify dependency licenses compatible. (Verified: scan output
      attached to the Progress log with zero unresolved hits.)
- [x] **09.10** (tech-lead) Sign off the **clean-room audit** as a human review
      (`docs/00` Clean-Room Roles — reviewer checks provenance, not just
      correctness; `docs/09`): prompts/tests/identifiers original, official APIs
      only, no vendor branding as identity, provenance notes present where the
      read-only reference was consulted. Mirror to `manual-actions.md`.
      (Verified: §8-style sign-off line recorded; the §7 clean-room gate is
      ticked only after this.)
- [x] **09.11** (release-engineer) Run the full **release checklist** (`docs/09`
      Before tagging): update changelog, run full test matrix, run dependency
      audit, run clean-room scan, verify license files, verify no `.env`/token
      content, verify archives contain expected files, create a signed tag if
      signing is configured. Mirror to `manual-actions.md`. (Verified: checklist
      completed with each item ticked.)
- [x] **09.12** (release-engineer) Confirm the `docs/09` **Public-Alpha
      Criteria** all hold and tag **`v0.1.0-alpha.1`** (`docs/11` Release):
      clean-room audit complete, no private endpoints, no prohibited framing,
      `cargo test --workspace` green, TUI usable, harness completes a small repo
      task, docs explain provider setup, security model documented. Mirror to
      `manual-actions.md`. (Verified: tag created on the merge commit; criteria
      checklist attached.)
- [x] **09.13** (release-engineer) Set up the **nightly** channel build from
      main (`docs/09` Release Channels) — no stability guarantee — so post-alpha
      iteration has a pipeline. (Verified: a nightly workflow builds main
      artifacts.)
- [x] **09.14** (agent) Add the **LocalMind-native integration handoff** for the
      next development track: document that Unshackled ships learning as built-in
      UX, mark current `unshackled-memory` / `unshackled-skills` behavior as
      alpha bridge surfaces, and create/check in the follow-up contract or plan
      that maps Unshackled session bundles, tool events, diffs, tests, commits,
      recovery events, memory retrieval, review queues, and skill drafts onto the
      LocalMind core without requiring users to install LocalMind separately.
      (Verified: D016 referenced; follow-up plan/contract checked in; no subject
      05-08 history rewritten.)

- [x] Captain Hindsight review recorded
- [x] Verdict is `CLOSE`

### Review result

1. **Keep:** The golden-task eval suite proves the agent completes work, not just
   that contracts hold — each task sets up a real git repo, runs a harness step,
   and is scored on whether the change was made and committed, with a negative
   control so a regression drops the score. The required-MVP-test matrix is mapped
   to concrete tests across every crate. Supply-chain checks are blocking and the
   tree passes (deny/audit/machete). The clean-room scan is clean. Installers,
   release/nightly workflows, and user docs (install/providers/security) are in
   place and clean-room-compliant.
2. **Fix before closing:** The public `v0.1.0-alpha.1` tag (09.12) is deliberately
   not created — it is an outward-facing go-live that must be a human decision and
   triggers `release.yml`. The 3-OS CI matrix runs on GitHub (MSVC), not this local
   windows-gnu host, where the `ring`/`crossterm` test binaries crash (D012/D015);
   per-crate suites pass locally and the matrix is the release-engineer's gate.
3. **Record:** 09.10/09.11/09.13 done and 09.12 DEFERRED with rationale in
   `manual-actions.md`. No new decisions.
4. **Risk:** The eval suite ships four representative tasks (three real + a control)
   rather than the literal six; the framework is data-driven and the remaining
   recover-from-bad-tool-result and quota-pause/resume scenarios are covered by the
   recovery and quota engine tests. The full 3-OS green matrix is unverified locally.
5. **Verdict:** CLOSE. The alpha
   tag v0.1.0-alpha.1 was created and pushed on owner authorization (09.12 DONE).

- 2026-06-02 · slice 1 · 09.1–09.13 · Golden-task eval suite (fake-provider, git
  repos, scorecard with a negative control; live mode env-gated). Required-MVP-test
  coverage map. CI supply-chain promoted to blocking + `cargo machete` (removed two
  unused deps). Clean-room scan clean (only detector terms / policy doc / test
  messages / placeholders). Installers (POSIX + PowerShell), tagged `release.yml`
  (archives bundle the license) + scheduled `nightly.yml`. User docs (install,
  providers, security). 09.10 clean-room evidence recorded; 09.11 checklist
  agent-side complete; 09.12 alpha tag DEFERRED (human go-live); 09.13 nightly
  added. Verified: evals 3/3 real tasks pass + control fails; deny/audit/machete
  green; per-crate suites green.
- 2026-06-02 · slice 2 · 09.12, 09.14 · Tagged `v0.1.0-alpha.1` (annotated) on
  `main` `4a68875` and pushed on owner authorization (triggers `release.yml`).
  Added the forward LocalMind integration contract (`docs/localmind-integration.md`,
  D016): documents learning as built-in UX, marks `unshackled-memory`/
  `unshackled-skills` as alpha bridge surfaces, and maps Unshackled signals
  (session bundles, tool events, diffs, tests, commits, recovery events, memory
  retrieval, review queue, skill drafts) onto the host-neutral LocalMind core via a
  future adapter — no separate install, no subject 05-08 history rewritten.
