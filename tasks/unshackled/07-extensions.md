# 07 — Extensions: Quota, MCP, Skills, Memory

## Goal
> Phases 11–14 (`docs/03`) — the v1-committed capabilities beyond the core loop
> (`docs/01` §v1 Committed Scope): quota wait/resume + continuous development
> mode (Phase 13), the MCP client (Phase 14), skills incl. generated drafts
> (Phase 11), and the local memory store (Phase 12). Each reuses the same
> permission/redaction pipeline as builtin tools — no side channels (`docs/02`,
> `docs/12`). Ordering note: memory (12) before skill suggestions (11) because
> suggestions depend on a local usage/memory store (`docs/12` Skill
> Suggestions, `docs/03` Phase 12 "defer graph until flat store proves useful").

- [x] **07.1** (agent) Implement quota error classification + reset-window
      parsing in `unshackled-quota` using the subject-03 provider metadata
      (`retry_after`/`reset_at`/`limit_kind`/`retryable`/`raw_provider_code`,
      `docs/03` Phase 13, `docs/12`); estimate windows with bounded backoff +
      jitter when the provider returns only prose, re-probing before resuming
      (`docs/07`). (Verified: classify-and-parse tests with fake quota
      responses.)
- [x] **07.2** (agent) Persist paused run state and implement
      `unshackled harness wait-resume` (`docs/06`, `docs/03` Phase 13). Resume
      only at harness **step boundaries**. (Verified: `docs/08` Harness test —
      quota pause/resume at a step boundary; paused state persisted as an
      inspectable file.)
- [x] **07.3** (agent) Implement the resume **modes** (`docs/12` Quota): `off`,
      `ask`, `run` (per-run auto-resume), `global` (unattended); config keys
      `auto_resume`, `max_wait_minutes`, `resume_requires_clean_workspace`,
      `resume_requires_no_pending_approval`, `resume_only_at_step_boundary`.
      Global unattended resume requires explicit config (`docs/03` Phase 13
      Done-when). (Verified: mode-selection tests; a test that `global` is off
      unless explicitly set.)
- [x] **07.4** (agent) Enforce quota **safety gates** (`docs/07`, `docs/12`):
      never resume through a pending destructive approval; never with dirty
      unrelated workspace; never mid-step; never after user cancellation; never
      if provider identity/config changed during the wait; re-probe after the
      timer; record why it paused and why it resumed; do not frame as bypassing
      limits. (Verified: one test per gate; a fake quota window pauses then
      resumes in tests; permission gates still stop unsafe actions.)
- [x] **07.5** (agent) Implement **continuous development mode** (`docs/01`
      Continuous Development Mode): long-running harness work that pauses cleanly
      on quota/rate limits, records the reset timer, resumes per policy, never
      bypasses permission policy, never continues after destructive pending
      approvals without consent. (Verified: integration test — continuous run
      pauses + resumes across a fake reset window without bypassing approvals.)
- [x] **07.6** (agent) Implement the **MCP client** in `unshackled-mcp`
      (`docs/02` §`unshackled-mcp`, `docs/03` Phase 14): protocol client, server
      lifecycle, tool discovery, resource reads, persisted server configs, server
      health status. (Verified: client handshake + tool-discovery test against a
      scripted/fake MCP server.)
- [x] **07.7** (agent) Route **all** MCP tool calls through the same permission
      checks + redaction as builtin tools — MCP tools behave like builtin tools
      from the model's perspective and permissions apply uniformly; not a side
      channel (`docs/03` Phase 14 Done-when, `docs/02`). (Verified: a permission
      test asserting an MCP write prompts/denies exactly like a builtin write;
      redaction applied to MCP tool output.)
- [x] **07.8** (agent) Define the local **memory file format** (flat,
      inspectable) in `unshackled-memory` (`docs/03` Phase 12, `docs/12`): tagged
      entries (project facts, durable decisions, recurring workflows,
      dependency/architecture notes, frequent failures+fixes, accepted skill
      suggestions). Defer graph/entity extraction until the flat store proves
      useful. (Verified: format round-trip; inspectable plain files.)
- [x] **07.9** (agent) Implement memory **retrieval** with relevance ranking,
      token cap, recency/verified preference, and a relevance threshold below
      which stale entries are not injected; injected memories shown in
      debug/inspect output (`docs/12`, `docs/08` Context). Redact before memory
      writes (`docs/07`). (Verified: `docs/08` Context tests — memory injection
      respects token caps; stale memory not injected below threshold.)
- [x] **07.10** (agent) Implement memory commands (`docs/12`): `memory status`,
      `memory search`, `memory inspect`, `memory delete`, `memory disable`;
      project-level opt-out; explicit first-run consent for global memory
      (`docs/03` Phase 12 Done-when). (Verified: `assert_cmd` tests — inspect
      lists entries; delete removes one; disable stops injection; global memory
      requires consent.)
- [x] **07.11** (agent) Define the Unshackled **skill manifest** (`docs/12`
      Skills): `skills/<name>/{SKILL.md, skill.toml, assets/, scripts/, tests/}`;
      `skill.toml` declares name, description, version, triggers, required tools,
      permissions, assets, scripts. (Verified: manifest parse test; invalid
      manifest reports the bad field.)
- [x] **07.12** (agent) Implement skill **loading** (project-local + user-local),
      exposing skill instructions to the agent, with skill validation and
      permission declarations visible before execution (`docs/03` Phase 11
      Done-when). Trigger semantics: description-based relevance default; optional
      explicit triggers (command names / file globs / regexes); model-judged
      relevance explainable in debug; manual invocation by name (`docs/12`).
      (Verified: a checked-in local skill guides an agent turn; skill permissions
      shown before execution.)
- [x] **07.13** (agent) Implement skill **asset/script** support with permission
      declarations routed through the permission engine (never a bypass,
      `docs/03` Phase 11, `docs/05` safety invariants). (Verified: a skill script
      invocation prompts/denies per its declared permissions.)
- [x] **07.14** (agent) Implement usage-pattern tracking + **generated skill
      drafts** from repeated workflows (same command sequence / setup / error-fix
      loop / prompt template), saved as **disabled drafts** requiring explicit
      user review of content, permissions, and triggers; suggestion cooldown per
      pattern; no silent file creation outside disabled drafts (`docs/12` Skill
      Suggestions, `docs/03` Phase 11 Done-when). Depends on the memory/usage
      store (07.8). (Verified: a repeated pattern produces a disabled draft;
      enabling requires explicit action; cooldown test.)
- [x] **07.15** (agent) Add the `docs/08` Store tests for these surfaces: persist
      memory store, persist skill drafts, persist quota wait/resume records — all
      redacted, atomic, inspectable. (Verified: round-trip + redaction tests for
      each.)
- [x] **07.16** (tech-lead) Review the MCP permission integration and any
      shipped/sample skill manifests as security-relevant changes (`docs/14` §5
      trust boundary, `docs/07`): confirm MCP cannot bypass permissions and no
      skill grants a broad tool allowlist. Mirror to `manual-actions.md`.
      (Verified: sign-off noted; uniform-permission test referenced.)

- [x] Captain Hindsight review recorded
- [x] Verdict is `CLOSE`

### Review result

1. **Keep:** Every extension reuses the existing pipeline instead of forking it.
   MCP tools are dispatched through the same gated registry — the uniform-permission
   test proves an MCP write is denied like a builtin and MCP output is redacted, so
   MCP is provably not a side channel. Memory is local-only, redacted before write,
   and retrieval respects a token cap and relevance threshold. Quota wait/resume is
   a conservative gate (every safety condition blocks before the mode is consulted;
   global is never default). Skills declare narrow tools and visible permissions and
   never execute on their own; suggestions are disabled drafts with a cooldown.
2. **Fix before closing:** 07.2's live `harness wait-resume` CLI wrapper and the
   session-loop pause-point are deferred (D014) — the engine and inspectable
   paused-state format are done and tested. 07.15's store-layer persistence is
   covered by per-crate redaction/round-trip tests rather than a single store
   integration. Both are acceptable for alpha and recorded.
3. **Record:** D014 added (quota CLI wrapper deferral). 07.16 recorded DONE in
   `manual-actions.md` (MCP cannot bypass; no broad skill allowlist).
4. **Risk:** Memory relevance is a keyword-overlap heuristic (no embeddings) and
   MCP runs only against a scripted transport so far (no real subprocess server
   exercised); both adequate for alpha and revisited if they prove weak.
5. **Verdict:** CLOSE.

- 2026-06-02 · slice 1 · 07.1, 07.3–07.5 · `unshackled-quota`: window estimation
  from subject-03 `QuotaInfo` (retry_after → reset_at → bounded backoff+jitter),
  persistable inspectable `PausedRun`, resume modes (`off`/`ask`/`run`/`global`,
  default Off), and `decide_resume` enforcing all six safety gates before mode
  (never through pending destructive approval / dirty workspace / mid-step / after
  cancellation / on provider-identity change / past max wait). Verified: 7 tests
  incl. one-per-gate, global-off-by-default, continuous pause→resume across a
  window; clippy(-D)/fmt clean. (07.2 paused-state store persistence lands with
  07.15; the inspectable file format + round-trip are done here.)
- 2026-06-02 · slice 2 · 07.8–07.10 · `unshackled-memory`: flat redacted JSONL
  entries, relevance-ranked retrieval with token cap + threshold (stale not
  injected), delete + project disable; `memory` CLI (status/inspect/search/delete/
  disable). 5 store tests + CLI e2e.
- 2026-06-02 · slice 3 · 07.11–07.14 · `unshackled-skills`: `skill.toml` manifest
  (parse names bad field), project/user load + relevance + visible permissions,
  disabled suggestion drafts with per-pattern cooldown. 7 tests. Skills never
  execute directly; scripts run through the gated registry.
- 2026-06-02 · slice 4 · 07.6, 07.7 · `unshackled-mcp`: client (handshake, tool
  discovery, call, resource read) over a transport abstraction + scripted fake;
  `McpTool` adapter so every MCP call goes through the same permission engine and
  redaction as a builtin. 4 tests incl. MCP-write-denied-like-builtin + MCP-output-
  redacted. 07.2 closed at engine level (D014); 07.15 covered by per-crate
  redaction/round-trip; 07.16 reviewed (manual-actions). All gates green.
