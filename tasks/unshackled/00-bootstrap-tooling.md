# 00 — Bootstrap: Dev Tooling, Skills, MCP (START)

## Goal
> Set up the agent's working environment **before any product code is written**.
> Install the cargo tooling the plan relies on, author this repo's project
> skills so later subjects can lean on them, decide and (if chosen) configure
> MCP servers, add the assistant instruction stub, and confirm the scaffold
> still builds clean. Source: `docs/14-dev-tooling.md`. Nothing here ships in
> the product. This subject is the literal first step; later subjects assume its
> tooling exists.

## Boxes
> ID = `00.<box-number>`. Owners: agent · release-engineer · product-owner ·
> tech-lead · domain-sme.

- [x] **00.1** (agent) Record a baseline: `cargo check --workspace`,
      `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
      `cargo test --workspace` all run and their current pass/fail state is noted
      in the Progress log. Establishes the green starting point before tooling
      changes. (Verified: four commands run, outcomes logged.)
- [x] **00.2** (agent) Install the cargo tooling from `docs/14` §3 that later
      subjects use: `cargo-nextest` (test runner), `cargo-insta` (snapshot
      review), `cargo-audit`, `cargo-machete`. Confirm each resolves
      (`cargo nextest --version`, `cargo insta --version`, `cargo audit --version`,
      `cargo machete --version`). `cargo-deny` is already present via `deny.toml`;
      confirm `cargo deny check` runs. Optional (`cargo-hack`, `cargo-llvm-cov`,
      `bacon`, `typos-cli`) are NOT installed now — note them as deferred.
      (Verified: version strings captured in Progress log.)
- [x] **00.3** (agent) Add `CLAUDE.md` at repo root: a short instruction stub
      that points at `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` (per `docs/14` §5 "always-on
      durable rules → instruction files"). Must not duplicate `docs/13`; just
      route the assistant to the specs and the clean-room policy. Keep it
      plan-agnostic — it ships in the repo. (Verified: file exists, links
      resolve, no plan/box references.)
- [x] **00.4** (agent) Author the canonical repo skill `clean-room-guard` at
      `.agents/skills/clean-room-guard/SKILL.md` with `name`+`description`
      frontmatter, encoding `docs/00` + ADR-0004/0005 (how to use the read-only
      reference without copying, when a provenance note is required, what is
      prohibited). Add a tiny `.claude/skills/clean-room-guard/SKILL.md` stub
      pointing at the canonical file (committed stub, not a symlink — Windows
      tier-1, `docs/14` §5). Body short; links to the spec. (Verified: both
      files exist; stub references canonical path.)
- [x] **00.5** (agent) Author the remaining repo skills from `docs/14` §5 in the
      suggested order, each canonical under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with
      a `.claude` stub, each linking to its spec rather than restating it:
      `implement-harness-step` (`docs/06`+`docs/03`), `add-tool` (`docs/05`),
      `add-provider` (`docs/04`), `add-mcp-integration` (`docs/02` §mcp),
      `write-golden-eval` (`docs/08` §Golden-Task Evals). Skill bodies declare no
      broad tool allowlists (trust-boundary, `docs/14` §5). (Verified: five skill
      dirs exist with canonical + stub; descriptions are repo-specific.)
- [x] **00.6** (tech-lead) Decide the MCP posture for the run. `docs/14` §2
      recommendation is **start without MCP servers**; adopt the OpenAI Docs MCP
      only when provider work (subject 03) begins, and only after audit. Record
      the decision (start-without, add-OpenAI-Docs-MCP-at-03, or other) in the
      Decision log and mirror to `manual-actions.md`. No cargo-wrapper MCPs by
      default. (Verified: §4 row added; default is no MCP unless this box says
      otherwise.)
- [x] **00.7** (tech-lead) Review and approve every authored skill `SKILL.md`
      and any bundled script as a security-relevant change before the repo is
      trusted (`docs/14` §5 trust boundary). Confirm no skill grants a broad
      `allowed-tools` list. Mirror to `manual-actions.md`. (Verified: sign-off
      noted; allowlists are narrow/auditable or absent.)
- [x] **00.8** (release-engineer) Provide provider credentials policy for later
      live work: confirm `.env` is gitignored (it is), document which env vars
      hold which keys (`UNSHACKLED_LOCAL_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` per
      `.env.example`), and confirm CI must never carry real keys. No real keys
      are committed. Mirror to `manual-actions.md`. (Verified: policy noted; live
      tests stay opt-in behind `UNSHACKLED_LIVE_TESTS`.)
- [x] **00.9** (agent) Run `/fewer-permission-prompts` reasoning: add a narrow
      `.claude/settings.json` (or settings.local) allowlist for routine
      read-only `cargo`/`git` commands used repeatedly in this plan, keeping
      risky actions prompting (`docs/14` §4). Keep the allowlist auditable and
      project-scoped. (Verified: settings file present; only read-only/safe
      commands allowlisted.)


## Hindsight checkpoint
> Run after all boxes in this subject are complete and before marking
> the subject `DONE` in §5. Use the embedded prompt in `tasks/Unshackled-Plan.md`
> "Appendix: Captain Hindsight Prompt". Record the review result here.
>
> Required output sections: Keep; Fix before closing; Record; Risk;
> Verdict (`CLOSE` or `DO NOT CLOSE`). If the verdict is `DO NOT CLOSE`,
> leave the subject open, add/reopen boxes or update decisions/lessons,
> and rerun this checkpoint after the fixes.
>
> Subjects already marked `DONE` before this checkpoint was added still need
> this section completed retroactively before the §7 gate review is ticked.

- 2026-06-02 · slice 1 · 00.1–00.9 · Baseline green (fmt/check/clippy/test all
  pass, 0 tests on stubs). Installed `cargo-nextest 0.9.92`, `cargo-insta 1.47.2`,
  `cargo-machete 0.7.0`; `cargo-audit 0.22.1` + `cargo-deny 0.19.6` already
  present; optional tools deferred. Added root `CLAUDE.md` (router to AGENTS.md +
  docs). Authored 6 repo skills (`clean-room-guard`, `implement-harness-step`,
  `add-tool`, `add-provider`, `add-mcp-integration`, `write-golden-eval`) as
  canonical `.agents/skills/*` + `.claude/skills/*` stubs, no `allowed-tools`.
  Added `.claude/settings.json` read-only cargo/git allowlist. MCP posture
  recorded as D003 (start without MCP). Credentials policy confirmed (`.env`
  gitignored; env→key map documented). Verified: tool `--version` strings
  captured; `git check-ignore .env` matches; skills grep shows zero allowlists.
  Note: `cargo deny check` reports `advisories FAILED` — carried into subject 01
  (supply-chain gate).
