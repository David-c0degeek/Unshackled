# 06 — Harness Core: Documents, Intake, Planning, Rules, Worker

## Goal
> Phases 5–8 (`docs/03`) — the product's defining loop (`docs/06`). Parse and
> render `brief.md`/`PROGRESS.md` losslessly; implement `init`, `status`,
> `intake`, `plan`, `feature`, `resume`; author original Unshackled prompts;
> build the deterministic rule engine (triggers, verdicts, baseline rules); and
> the worker that executes plan steps one at a time with the anti-sunk-cost
> replan loop and per-step commits. Project files are source of truth
> (ADR-0003); the rule engine layers on top of the permission engine and MUST
> NOT bypass it (`docs/06`). Prompts are original, tested as product behaviour
> (`docs/00`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Boxes
> ID = `06.<box-number>`. Owners: agent · tech-lead.

- [x] **06.1** (agent) Define + implement the `brief.md` schema and a
      parser/renderer (`docs/06`): required sections Summary, Requirements,
      Constraints, Non-Goals, Acceptance Criteria; lossless where possible;
      accept both `\n` and `\r\n` (`docs/13` §7). (Verified: `docs/08` Harness
      tests — parse valid brief; reject brief missing a required section, naming
      the section.)
- [x] **06.2** (agent) Define + implement the `PROGRESS.md` schema and
      parser/renderer (`docs/06`): `Branch:` line, numbered steps with `[ ]`/`[x]`,
      completed-step metadata (`commit:`, `attempts:`). User-edited files
      accepted if semantically valid; malformed files report exact section/line
      (`docs/03` Phase 5 Done-when). (Verified: `docs/08` Harness tests — parse
      valid progress; reject duplicate step number; round-trip render is
      lossless.)
- [x] **06.3** (agent) Implement `unshackled init` (`docs/06`): create
      `.unshackled.toml`, add `.gitignore` entry for `.unshackled/`, optionally
      init git. (Verified: `assert_cmd` test on a temp dir — files created,
      gitignore entry present.)
- [x] **06.4** (agent) Implement `unshackled harness status` (`docs/06`):
      read-only summary — current branch, next step, completed count, dirty
      state, test command, provider config status — and it MUST work without a
      model provider (`docs/03` Phase 5 Done-when). (Verified: snapshot test of
      status output on a fixture repo, no provider configured.)
- [ ] **06.5** (agent) Author the **original Unshackled intake prompt** and
      implement `unshackled harness intake` (`--idea`, `--refine`, `--continue`,
      `--auto`, `docs/06`): idea → `brief.md` + `.unshackled/intake.jsonl`.
      Validate generated artifacts before writing; invalid model output is
      retried with validation feedback (`docs/03` Phase 6). Prompt lives in a
      harness module and is snapshot-tested (`docs/13` §10). (Verified: idea →
      `brief.md` works with the fake provider; invalid-output retry test;
      prompt snapshot.)
- [ ] **06.6** (agent) Author the **original Unshackled planner prompt** and
      implement `unshackled harness plan` (`--replan`, `docs/06`): `brief.md` +
      repo summary → `PROGRESS.md` with numbered steps, branch name, test
      strategy. Validate before writing (`docs/03` Phase 6). (Verified:
      `brief.md` → `PROGRESS.md` works with the fake provider; prompt snapshot;
      invalid-output retry test.)
- [ ] **06.7** (agent) Create prompt fixtures + snapshot tests and iterate
      prompts against golden tasks; prompt changes are reviewed through snapshot
      diffs and eval scores (`docs/03` Phase 6 Done-when, `docs/08` Snapshot).
      Fixtures authored for this repo, never copied (`docs/08` Fixture Policy).
      (Verified: `cargo insta` snapshots for intake + planner prompts; eval hook
      ready for subject 09.)
- [ ] **06.8** (agent) Implement `unshackled harness feature` (`docs/06`): a
      feature description → appended brief notes + appended/inserted progress
      steps without renumbering completed steps. (Verified: test — feature
      append leaves existing step IDs/commit metadata intact.)
- [x] **06.9** (agent) Define rule-engine **trigger** types (`docs/06`):
      `session_start`, `pre_tool`, `post_tool`, `pre_edit`, `post_edit`,
      `pre_shell`, `post_shell`, `pre_commit`, `post_test`, `step_complete`.
      (Verified: trigger enum + dispatch test.)
- [x] **06.10** (agent) Define **verdict** types + the rule registry (`docs/06`):
      `allow`, `warn`, `retry`, `discard`, `block`. Config can tighten policy but
      MUST NOT silently bypass critical rules (`docs/03` Phase 7 Done-when).
      (Verified: verdict enum; a test that config cannot downgrade a critical
      rule to allow.)
- [ ] **06.11** (agent) Implement the **baseline rules** (`docs/06`):
      `no_stale_uncommitted` (session_start blocks on unrelated uncommitted
      files), `workspace_boundary` (pre file-tool), `secret_file_guard` (ask
      before `.env`/keys/credential stores/token-bearing cloud config),
      `test_first_when_configured` (warn/block), `suite_green` (tests pass before
      step completion), `progress_updated` (PROGRESS.md reflects completion
      before final commit), `commit_message_clean` (no secrets / vendor-internal
      refs / private impl names), `attempt_limit`. Each rule is unit tested;
      failures are visible to model and user (`docs/03` Phase 7 Done-when).
      (Verified: `docs/08` Harness tests — rule retry path; rule discard path;
      one unit test per baseline rule.)
- [x] **06.12** (agent) Implement rule **config overrides** and attempt counters
      driven by `[harness.rules]` and `attempts_per_step` (`docs/06`). (Verified:
      `docs/08` Harness tests — attempt counter increment; config override
      changes a non-critical rule's verdict.)
- [ ] **06.13** (agent) Implement the worker role + **next-incomplete-step
      selection** (`docs/03` Phase 8, `docs/06`): start from committed state,
      build the worker prompt from the step + current state, run the subject-05
      agent loop for one step. (Verified: `docs/08` Harness tests — next
      incomplete step selection; mark step complete.)
- [ ] **06.14** (agent) Implement step completion flow (`docs/02` §Harness
      Resume, `docs/06` Commit Policy): run post-step rules → run tests if
      configured (`suite_green`) → commit if rules pass (one commit per completed
      step, `harness: <step description>` message) → update PROGRESS.md → commit
      progress update. Commits go through the permission engine + `git_commit`
      tool (subject 04). (Verified: end-to-end on a sample repo — one commit per
      completed step; PROGRESS.md updated.)
- [ ] **06.15** (agent) Implement the **anti-sunk-cost loop** (`docs/06`,
      `docs/03` Phase 8): `retry` keeps context + feeds back the reason;
      `discard` saves an attempt log and restores committed state with **fresh**
      context; after capped discard/retry failures, replan the step with the
      attempt logs; cap replans to avoid runaway automation. Discards reset the
      working tree only inside the target workspace (`docs/01` Job 4). (Verified:
      `docs/08` Harness tests — replan cap; a repeated-failure scenario triggers
      context reset + replan; attempt logs persisted.)
- [ ] **06.16** (agent) Implement `unshackled harness resume` (`docs/06`,
      `docs/02` §Harness Resume) tying it together: load config/brief/progress,
      validate repo state, select next step, run worker, pause-point hook for
      quota (subject 07), run rules/tests, commit, mark done, stop/continue.
      Implement the three harness entry paths (`docs/06`): ground-up, single
      task, adopt-existing (summarize repo → generate/import brief+progress →
      resume). Implement mode switching at safe boundaries (`docs/11`).
      (Verified: a small sample repo completes a task end to end via resume;
      adopt-existing path generates a valid brief+progress.)
- [ ] **06.17** (agent) Implement worker-loop **trace events** (`docs/03` Phase
      8, `docs/11`) instrumented via `tracing` spans (chat turn, tool call,
      harness step, provider request; skip secret/large fields, `docs/13` §11).
      Snapshot-test the trace event shape (`docs/08` Snapshot). (Verified: trace
      snapshot test; spans skip secret fields.)
- [ ] **06.18** (tech-lead) Review the intake + planner prompts and the rule
      verdict severities (which rules are `block` vs `warn`) for product
      correctness and clean-room provenance before they are locked
      (`docs/00`, `docs/06`). Record any prompt/severity amendment in §4; mirror
      to `manual-actions.md`. (Verified: §4 row or explicit sign-off that
      defaults stand.)

- 2026-06-02 · slice 1 · 06.1, 06.2 · `brief.md` + `PROGRESS.md` document model in
  `unshackled-harness`: section-based parsers that accept `\n`/`\r\n`, name a
  missing required brief section, reject duplicate progress step numbers, and a
  lossless render round-trip; `Progress` helpers (`next_incomplete`,
  `completed_count`, `mark_complete`). Verified: 8 doc tests (valid parse, missing
  section named, CRLF, duplicate-step rejection, render round-trips); clippy(-D)/
  fmt clean.
