LocalPilot is a Rust-native, provider-neutral coding-agent harness.

Maintained by C0deGeek.dev (David, Bram).
Repository: <https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalPilot>
Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS — all first-class, tier-1 platforms.

## LocalX Ecosystem

- [LocalStack](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalStack) is the umbrella
  ecosystem for the LocalX tools.
- [LocalBox](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalBox) is the model runtime
  and launcher for local GGUF models.
- [LocalMind](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalMind) is the local-first
  learning engine for reviewed project memory, graph-connected knowledge,
  reusable skills, and agent context, embedded by LocalPilot.
- [LocalBench](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalBench) is the benchmarking
  and evaluation companion for local model/runtime choices.
- [LocalPilot](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalPilot) is this local CLI
  coding agent.

It is not a fork, clone, port, or redistribution of any vendor CLI. The project
is designed from first principles around a small set of public concepts:

- a terminal interface for agentic software development
- two operating modes: a default conversational agent mode and an opt-in,
  rule-enforced harness mode
- official model/provider APIs and local OpenAI-compatible servers
- a rule-enforced harness that turns vague tasks into inspectable plans
- local state stored in ordinary project files
- explicit permission boundaries for filesystem, shell, network, and external tools

## Project status

Pre-release alpha. The full agent loop, harness, tools, permissions, provider
adapters, TUI, MCP integration, headless drive (stdio RPC + an Agent Client
Protocol adapter), durable session event log with resume/fork, and the
LocalMind learning subsystem are implemented and tested across Windows, Linux,
and macOS in CI. The runtime's guarantees are written down as a tested
reliability contract ([`docs/06`](docs/06-harness-spec.md),
[`docs/07`](docs/07-security-and-privacy.md)). The one gate before a tagged
public alpha is a live run against a real provider (the suite is offline by
default).

It contains no implementation copied from any closed-source or leaked codebase.

## Getting started

Clone with submodules (the LocalMind learning engine is vendored as one):

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalPilot.git
# or, in an existing clone:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build and check the environment:

```sh
cargo build -p localpilot
cargo run -p localpilot -- doctor
```

Point it at a provider in `.localpilot.toml` (official API or a local
OpenAI-compatible server such as llama.cpp / Ollama / vLLM):

```toml
[provider]
default = "local"

[providers.local]
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:8080/v1"
model = "your-local-model"
# api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"   # for a hosted API
```

Then talk to it:

```sh
localpilot ask --model your-local-model "explain this repo's error handling"
localpilot chat                 # interactive REPL (release builds)
localpilot                      # no args: launches the REPL, or doctor if unset
```

See [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md) for provider setup (including
per-model context windows and reasoning effort),
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) for the full config reference
and stability policy, [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md) for MCP tool servers,
[`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for adding providers, tools, and
in-process hooks, and [`docs/embedding.md`](docs/embedding.md) for embedding
the runtime in-process or driving it headless over RPC/ACP.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `doctor` | Report version, platform, config, providers, tools, trust state |
| `update [--check]` | Check the repo for a newer release and reinstall from source on confirm |
| `init` | Initialize project-local state (`.localpilot.toml`, `.gitignore`) |
| `ask` | Send one prompt and stream the answer (no tools) |
| `chat` | Interactive terminal REPL with tool approvals, a working indicator, and a task panel |
| `print` | Run the agent loop once non-interactively (pipelines); `--continue` / `--resume <id>` pick up an existing session |
| `models` | List what configured OpenAI-compatible servers actually have loaded (`GET /models`), with context windows where reported |
| `session list \| export \| resume` | Inspect, export, or resume durable sessions rebuilt from the event log |
| `rpc` | Drive the runtime over stdin/stdout: newline-delimited JSON commands in, streamed session events out |
| `acp` | Serve the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio) for editor integrations |
| `harness intake \| plan \| feature \| resume \| wait-resume` | Rule-enforced mode: idea → `brief.md` → `PROGRESS.md` → worked, committed steps; pause/resume on quota |
| `memory` | Inspect/search/manage local project memory |
| `learning` | LocalMind loop: `closeout`, `review`, `promote`, `search`, `skills`, `audit` |
| `export` | Export a redacted session bundle |

### Chat controls

`PageUp` and `PageDown` scroll the transcript. The default mouse mode keeps
normal terminal selection available and disables terminal alternate-scroll so
wheel notches do not navigate the input history. Press `F12` to toggle
mouse-wheel scrolling for the transcript; in wheel mode, wheel notches use the
same transcript paging path as `PageUp` and `PageDown`. Press `F12` again to
restore normal terminal selection. Bracketed paste stays enabled in both mouse
modes. Set
`LOCALPILOT_ENABLE_MOUSE_CAPTURE=1` to start in wheel mode.

## Build features

The default binary links the LocalMind learning subsystem. The `tui` feature
adds the interactive `chat` REPL; `learning` remains accepted as a compatibility
alias for older build commands.

```sh
cargo build -p localpilot --features tui
```

## Design principles

1. Original implementation only.
2. Official APIs (or local servers) only — no private/undocumented endpoints.
3. Provider-neutral core.
4. Local-first project state.
5. Explicit user control for risky actions; `bypass` is never the default.
6. Reproducible planning and progress.
7. No hidden consumer-product automation.
8. No vendor branding as product identity.
